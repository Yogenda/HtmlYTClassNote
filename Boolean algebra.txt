What is Boolean Algebra?
it is branch of algebra that deals with Boolean values true and false.
it is a fundamental to digital logic design and computer science, provide the mathematical framework for describing logical operations and expressions.

Boolean Algebra Operation
Negation (NOT operation)
Conjunction (AND operation)
Disjunction (OR operation)

operator	symbol		precedence
NOT		' (or)		first
AND		. (or) ^	Second
OR		+ (or) V	Third


Negation (NOT operation)
NOT operation reverse the value of the Boolean variable from 0 to 1 or vice-versa.
- if A=1, then use NOT operation we have (A)' = 0
- if A=0, then use NOT operation we have (A)' = 1
- we can also represent the negation as ~A, ie. A=1, ~A=0


Conjunction (AND operation)
the condition if both the values of individual variable is true and if any of the value is false then this operation gives the negative result/false. 
- A=True, B=True, then A.B= True
- A=True, B=False, or A=false, B=True, then A.B= False
- A=False, B=False then A.B= False

Disjunction (OR operation)
the condition if any value of the individual variable is true it only give the negative result if both the values are false.
- A=True, B=True, then A+B=True
- A=True, B=False, or A=False, B=True, A+B= True
- A=False, B=False, A+B=False

operations	symbols			Definition
AND		. OR ^			true if both are 					true
OR		+ OR V			true if at lease 					one input true
NOT		~ 			Reverse the input
XOR		O+ 			true if exact one 					input is true
NAND		down arrow V|		False only if 						both input are 						true.
NOR		up arrow |^		false if at lease 					one input is 						true.
XNOR 		both side arrow <->	true if both 						input are equal.

class 6
Boolean expressions and variable
it an expression that provides a Boolean value when evaluate.
Boolean variables are variables stored in Boolean numbers.
P+Q=R
p,q,r Boolean variables. 2 values store: 0 and 1 / true and false

A+B = True
A.B = True
(A)' = False


Boolean algebra Terminologies
- Boolean variable
- Literal
- Boolean Functions
- Complements
- Truth table


Boolean variable: variable used in Boolean algebra that stores the logical values of 0 and 1

Boolean Functions: A function of Boolean Algebra that is formed by the user of Boolean variable and Boolean operators.
AND, OR, and NOT use for logical expressions.


Literal: A variables or the complement of the variable.
	they represents operands in logical operator.


Complements: inverse of Boolean variable is called as complects.
	complements of 0 is 1 and complement of 1 is 0.
	

Truth table: it is the combination of input and output values in table format. 
no of rows in truth table is = 2n
n is the number of Boolean variable used.

Draw A+B and A.B truth table.
A B	x=A+B	Y=A.B
T T	T	T
T F	T	F
F T	T	F
F F	F	F


Boolean Algebra Rules
- Binary Representation: 0 or 1 (0 represents low and 1 represents high)
- Complement Representation: (A)' A complement if A=0 then o/p A=1
- OR operation: represents as + (A,B,C) OR A+B+C
- AND operation: denoted as . (A.B.C) or ABC


Laws
- Identity Law: 
	A+0=A
	A.1=A

- Commutative Law:
	A.B = B.A
	A+B = B+A

- Associative Law:
	(A.B).C=A.(B.C)
	(A+B)+C=A+(B+C)

- AND Law: 
	A.0=0
	A.1=A
	A.A=A

- OR Law:
	A+0=A
	A+1=1
	A+A=A

- Complement Law: 
	A+A' = 1
	A.A = 0
