3 type of CSS:
    - Inline CSS: styling will done on a specific tag in a singl line. and styling will be 
        done in html page itself.
        <h1 style="color: blue;">Hello I am H1 tag</h1>
        attribute used = style=""

    - Internal CSS: the styling part will done inside the html page itself. but inside the
        <head> </head>  we have to add additional tag for styling <style> .... </style>

    - External CSS: you have to create the additional file with the extention of .css
        for the styling purpose. 
        we have to link the css file with the html file.
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="../style1.css">
            attribute
                - rel - it will tell use the link is relate to which type
                - href - hyperlink refference - we have add the link.
