comments: /*-------styling---------*/

Ways of using CSS: 
3 type of CSS:
    - Inline CSS: styling will done on a specific tag in a singl line. and styling will be 
        done in html page itself.
        <h1 style="color: blue;">Hello I am H1 tag</h1>
        attribute used = style=""

    - Internal CSS: the styling part will done inside the html page itself. but inside the
        <head> </head>  we have to add additional tag for styling <style> .... </style>

    - External CSS: you have to create the additional file with the extention of .css
        for the styling purpose. 
        we have to link the css file with the html file.
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="../style1.css">
            attribute
                - rel - it will tell use the link is relate to which type
                - href - hyperlink refference - we have add the link.

Syntax: 
    selector{ property : value;}
    h3{color: cadetblue;}

Selector:
    - Element selector: all html tags  (p, h1-h6, pre, a, u, table.......)
        h3{color: cadetblue;}
    
    - Class selector: we have to tage the class name with the help of "." folowed by the 
        class name.
            .std{background-color:beige ;}
    
    - ID Selector: we have to tage the ID name with the help of "#" folowed by the ID name.
        #cl{background-color: burlywood;}
    
    - Grouping selector: we have to select many tags at once seprated by ,
        p,pre,h4{color: coral;}


-------------------------------------
Class 2
Element selector < Class selector < ID Selector
Element selector: least prefference  
Class selector: greater than element selector
ID Selector: it is greatest of all the selector among element and class selector


Global selector: it will contain all the comon things to use in website.


CSS heighest prefference: 
Inline > Internal > External
Inline CSS: it is having the greates prefference.
Internal CSS: it is less than inline css and greater than external css.
External CSS: it is having the least prefference of all type of css.



Colors:
purpose: 
    - to make our website looks good.
    - make our website or page more readable.

Format:
    - Named color: you will add the specific color name Red, green, blue, pink, orange.
        https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/
    (quick use, less practical)

    - Hexadecimal: #9acd32ff (Standard for website creation)
        #000000- black (#000)
        #ffffff - white (#fff)

    - RGB/RGBA: range starting from 0 to 255 (greater for dynamic colors, and we can make out color transparent)
        rgba(153, 205, 50, 1)
        transparent: range start form 0 to 1 
            1: minimun transparent
            0: maximum transparent

    - hsl/hsla: hsla(80, 61%, 50%, 1.00)
        transparent: range start form 0.00 to 1.00 
            1: minimun transparent
            0: maximum transparent

-------------------------------------
Class 3
Background:
What are the things we can use as a background?
- Background color
- Background images
- Background Gradient
we can use properties to set where we want this things.

Background color: 
    background-color:- it is used to set the background color of an element.
        ways we can color name: hsl/hsla, RGB/RGBA, Hexadecimal, Color name
    body{
        background-color: antiquewhite;
    }

    background-image:this property is used to set the background image of an element.
        propert to used that is URL() it will tell whats the location of an image.

        we can also set multiple background images at one but they will in layer form.
    body{
        background-image: url('../img/Git.png'), url('../img/Java.png');
    }

    Background Repeat: by defalut it is set to repeat thata why images are coming in repated form.
        background-repeat: ;
            repeat: defalut 
            repeat-x: it will repeat the image in x axis
            repeat-y: it will repeat the image in y axis
            no-repeat: it will not repeat the image

    background position: it is used to set the image location.
        top, right, left, bottom.
        background-position: right top;

    background-size: contain;
                    cover
                    auto

    background short hand: background: #000 url('../img/Git.png') no-repeat left bottom;


-------------------------------------
Class 4
What is border?
    Border is defined as a outline across the element.

by defalut border propert is "Not visible" (border-style: none)

3 main properts of border
- border-width: it defines the thikness of border - defalut(medium 3-4px)
- border-style: border type (solid, bouble, dashed, groove, dotted..... ) - defalut (none - invisible)
- border-color: color of a border - (defalut- depend on the element/ mostly it black)

Best practice:
- solid - clean, proffessional look
- dashed/dotted - warding, imprortant, highlight
- mostly we use border-bottom or border-left to make it more professional
- always use the contrasting colors in border.
- border-radius use to make it look more professional


what is Box shadow?
    it is added the shadow effect around the element.

Best practice:
- use shadow to elevate the buttons and cards
- avoid using dark shadow as they are old fashion.
- use the rgba to give the more nature look
- use complex shadow in the large design

Defalut box shadow property: none (No shadow)

horizontal-offset(required): right (+), left(-)
vertical-offset(required): bottom (+), top(-)
blur-radius(optional): 
spread-radius(optional): + value if grow, - value to shrink
color: we select the color(defalut black)

Syntex:
box-shadow: [horizontal-offset] [vertical-offset] blur-radius spread-radius color;

-------------------------------------
Class 5
Text Shadows: it adds the shadow effect to text, improve readablity.

What is the defalut text shadow property.
- by defalut no text shadow (text-shadow: none)

text-shadow: [horizontal-offset] [vertical-offset] blur-radius color

best practice:
- use light colors with low opacity.
- avoid over use in body text, best for heading and small heading.


Typography
it is used to create web page more readable.

Font-Family: it the typeface used by the text.
Defalut font in browser: serif or sans-serif
small strok at the end of word are serif
no strokes at the end of words sans serif

font-size: it is used to controle the size of text
    defalut: usually 16px;
    unit: px, em, rem, %, vw()

em/rem: are related to parent/root font size.

-------------------------------------
Class 6
px: fix size. relative to the screen pixels (border, fix layout)
em: it is related to its parent font size. related to parent element, (padding, margin)
rem: it is related to its <html> root dir. related to root element(consistent spacing, typography)
    1rem = 16px
%: persentage of parent size related to parent element (_fluid layout, responsive container)
    Note: % behaves same as em (related to its parent)
vw: persentage of viewport width. (responsive layout. full width element or view port dependecy)

Font weight: text thickness controle
    defalut : normal (400)
        normal (400)
        bold(700)
        range of number start from 100-900

Font style: contols the style (normal, italic, oblique)
    defalut : normal


Text-Decoration: used to decorate the text like underline, strike through, overline
    CSS3 allows multiple value style like dotted, double...
    defalut: none

Text-transformation: it is used to control the capatilization
    defalut: none
    value: none, uppercase, lowercase, capatilization

Line-height
letter spacing
word spacing
text align

-------------------------------------
Class 7
Margin and padding
fundamentals layout tools, controle the spacing around and inside the element. 
for better visiblity

margin defalut value: 0

margin is the diff b/w elements

padding: space b/w the border and the content
padding defalut value: 0
manage the space b/w the contenet and the border.

margin vs padding
feature                 margin                              padding
- location              outside element border              inside the element border
- background visible    No                                  yes 
- collapse              vertical margins can be collapse    padding doesnot collapsed.
- use case              use to seprate the elements         seprate the content from the border for better readiblity.


short hand for margin and padding
- 1 value : applied to all side
- 2 values: vertical | horizontal
- 3 values: top | horizontal | bottom
- 4 values: top | right | bottom | left


-------------------------------------
Class 8
box size: content box - border box
box-size: it is used to calculate the width and height of an element
box-size: content box
    - The width and height applied only to the content.
    - padding and border are added outside the set width/height increase the total space.

acutal width:
    width: 200px
        20px padding left/right
        5px border right/left
    200+20+20+5+5 = 250px total width


box-size: border box - 
acutal width:
    width: 200px (include padding and border)
        20px padding left/right
        5px border right/left
    200 - (20*2)-(5*2) = 
    200-40-10= 150px

content box                             border box
width+padding+border                width(all included)

NOTE: for predictable layout especially with the grid layout and 
responsive design use border-box.


Overflow: controles what happened if content overflow in container box.
    - hidden - not visible, clip - scrollbar not visible
    - visible (Defalut) - show text outside the box - scrollbar not visible
    - scroll - clip, but scroll - scrollbar is visible
    - auto - clip, but scroll - if only required visible


Outline vs border

border: 
    affects the layout: yes
    display: color,width, style, (top, bottom, left, right)
    visible in box model: visible b/w paddding and margin.
    eg: card, button, etc.

Outline:
    affects the layout: No (doesnot takes the space)
    display: supported by element, directions not there.
    visible in box model: selection, heighlight, get the focus
    can not have border radius in few explorer, shap will always be rectangle.


-------------------------------------
Class 9
Display properties: it controles the elements visual fomat.

new line
height and width not set
margin and padding vertical can be set
margin and padding horizontal can be set
    - block: section format
    - inline: text styling
    - inlin-block: buttons/menues
    - none: Toggle the text /show - hide

Display block:
    tag: div, h1-h6, form, header, footer, ul, li, etc.

- starts from the new line
- take the entire width of patent elemtn (defalut)
- width, height, padding, margin properties.
- stack: vertical align

Display inline:
    span, a, strong, img, etc.

- not starts from the new line
- top and bottom margin and padding not work only horizontal (left/right) will work
- heigth and width not able to set


display: inlin-block
    no such tag you have set it manually in css.

it inclue the property of both inline and block

----
Class 10:

positions: it tells how the elements has to be placed in the document.
used mainly for fundamentals of design
    - static (defalut)
    - relative
    - absolute
    - fixed
    - sticky

Static (defalut): 
    - it is defalut position for all the elements
    - elements are positiond according to the normal document flow.
    - top, right, left, bottom position not applied
    - doesnot remove the element from the normal flow

Relative
    - top, right, left, bottom move the element related to the normal position
    - the elements and be overlapsed to each other.
    - mostly used with absolute position
    - z-index

absolute
    - 

-----------------------------
class 11

fixed
    - position will be related to the viewport (browser windows)
    - fixed at a specific place even if we scroll our page.
    - right, left, top, bottom yes we can use it.
    - sticky header, floating action button.
    - use the z-index to place the element on top of other.

best used for;
    - Nav bar, chat widget, button

sticky
    - 



------------------- class 12 ---------------
Float & clear
Float: if you want to wrap the image around the text then we can use the float.
    - left: element float to left
    - right: element float to right
    - none: defalut, no float
    - inherit: move as the parent flow.


clear: it will prevent the element flowing around
    - left: ement move below left floated ement
    - right: element move below the right side
    - both: cleard the element from left and right (mostly used)
    - none: by defalut


Flex box: ​flex mean is a layout model that makes it easier to arrange elements 
inside a container — especially when you need alignment, spacing.
    - 1d layout model
    - elements are placed in row or column
    - alignement will be done in a container
    - modern solution


float vs flex box
float - Text wrap | not good for responsive design
flex blox - Design specific | best for responsive design (flex-wrap, )


------------------- class 13 ---------------
grid
    css grid will place the elements in 2 dimention format (row and column)
    best used for image, dashboard, page layout, etc.

    defalut: elements are in vertical / horizontal form stacked on each other.
    
    properties:
        - grid-template-column: define the size of column.
                values can be absolute(px) or relative(%, rem)
        - grid-template-row: define the size of row in a grid.
        - row/column gap: add the space b/w the row or column
        - grid-template-area: 


multi column 
    multiple column layout like a newspaper
    best used for article and newspaper writing

    properties:
        - column-count: it defines the number of coulmns 
                Defalut: 1 (No column just a single block)
        - column-gap: controles the gap b/w the column
                defalut: 1em
        - column-rule: help you to draw the line b/w columns

grid vs multi column
Grid 
    - complet customization (row, column, overlapsed).
    - gap, column-gap, row-gap
    - no direct rule for colum

Multi Column
    - Limited to only column text change
    - column-gap
    - column-rule to make it more beauti


----------------Class 14------------  
Responsive Design (RWD): its an approach to develope web pages and you 
can render the contendt as per different screen size.

Viewport Meta tage: it controles the website how it will look like on mobile device.
    desktop screen size: 980px
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        width=device-width: set the width of viewport to the device width.
        initial-scale=1.0: set the inital zoom by 1
        minimun-scale=1.0
        maximum-scale=1.0
        user-scalable = no : prevent the user from zooming on page.

Media Query: apply the css rule based on the device
    Syntex: 
        @media media-type and (media-features){
            /*css rules */
        }
    media-features:
        min-width: you can set the viewport width
        max-width: viewport is narrow now so the special value will be applied.
        orientation: portrate or landscape
        resolution: 
        width, min-width, max-width
        height, min-height, max-height
    media-type:
        all: suitable for all devices
        print: for printing the content
        screen: for computer scree, tablet, mobilephone
        speech: for screenreader.
    Logical Operations:
        and: combine the multiple media function
        not: negate the entire media query
        only: hides the stylesheet
        ,(comma): Acts as a OR operator

Flexible Image:
    img{
        max-width: 100%;
        heigh: auto
    }

Relative Units:
    %,em, rem, vw, vh

Break Point: 
    mobile: <768px
    tablet: 768px - 1024px
    desktop: >1024px
