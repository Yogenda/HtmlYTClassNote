Ways of using CSS: 
3 type of CSS:
    - Inline CSS: styling will done on a specific tag in a singl line. and styling will be 
        done in html page itself.
        <h1 style="color: blue;">Hello I am H1 tag</h1>
        attribute used = style=""

    - Internal CSS: the styling part will done inside the html page itself. but inside the
        <head> </head>  we have to add additional tag for styling <style> .... </style>

    - External CSS: you have to create the additional file with the extention of .css
        for the styling purpose. 
        we have to link the css file with the html file.
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="../style1.css">
            attribute
                - rel - it will tell use the link is relate to which type
                - href - hyperlink refference - we have add the link.

Syntax: 
    selector{ property : value;}
    h3{color: cadetblue;}

Selector:
    - Element selector: all html tags  (p, h1-h6, pre, a, u, table.......)
        h3{color: cadetblue;}
    
    - Class selector: we have to tage the class name with the help of "." folowed by the 
        class name.
            .std{background-color:beige ;}
    
    - ID Selector: we have to tage the ID name with the help of "#" folowed by the ID name.
        #cl{background-color: burlywood;}
    
    - Grouping selector: we have to select many tags at once seprated by ,
        p,pre,h4{color: coral;}


-------------------------------------
Class 2
Element selector < Class selector < ID Selector
Element selector: least prefference  
Class selector: greater than element selector
ID Selector: it is greatest of all the selector among element and class selector


Global selector: it will contain all the comon things to use in website.


CSS heighest prefference: 
Inline > Internal > External
Inline CSS: it is having the greates prefference.
Internal CSS: it is less than inline css and greater than external css.
External CSS: it is having the least prefference of all type of css.



Colors:
purpose: 
    - to make our website looks good.
    - make our website or page more readable.

Format:
    - Named color: you will add the specific color name Red, green, blue, pink, orange.
        https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/
    (quick use, less practical)

    - Hexadecimal: #9acd32ff (Standard for website creation)
        #000000- black (#000)
        #ffffff - white (#fff)

    - RGB/RGBA: range starting from 0 to 255 (greater for dynamic colors, and we can make out color transparent)
        rgba(153, 205, 50, 1)
        transparent: range start form 0 to 1 
            1: minimun transparent
            0: maximum transparent

    - hsl/hsla: hsla(80, 61%, 50%, 1.00)
        transparent: range start form 0.00 to 1.00 
            1: minimun transparent

    body{
        background-color: antiquewhite;
    }

    background-image:this property is used to set the background image of an element.
        propert to used that is URL() it will tell whats the location of an image.

        we can also set multiple background images at one but they will in layer form.
    body{
        background-image: url('../img/Git.png'), url('../img/Java.png');
    }

    Background Repeat: by defalut it is set to repeat thata why images are coming in repated form.
        background-repeat: ;
            repeat: defalut 
            repeat-x: it will repeat the image in x axis

Class 4
What is border?
    Border is defined as a outline across the element.

by defalut border propert is "Not visible" (border-style: none)

3 main properts of border
- border-width: it defines the thikness of border - defalut(medium 3-4px)
- border-style: border type (solid, bouble, dashed, groove, dotted..... ) - defalut (none - invisible)
- border-color: color of a border - (defalut- depend on the element/ mostly it black)

Best practice:
- solid - clean, proffessional look
- dashed/dotted - warding, imprortant, highlight
- mostly we use border-bottom or border-left to make it more professional
- always use the contrasting colors in border.
- border-radius use to make it look more professional


what is Box shadow?
    it is added the shadow effect around the element.

Best practice:
- use shadow to elevate the buttons and cards
- avoid using dark shadow as they are old fashion.
- use the rgba to give the more nature look
- use complex shadow in the large design

Defalut box shadow property: none (No shadow)

horizontal-offset(required): right (+), left(-)
vertical-offset(required): bottom (+), top(-)
blur-radius(optional): 
spread-radius(optional): + value if grow, - value to shrink
color: we select the color(defalut black)

Syntex:
box-shadow: [horizontal-offset] [vertical-offset] blur-radius spread-radius color;

-------------------------------------
Class 5
Text Shadows: it adds the shadow effect to text, improve readablity.

What is the defalut text shadow property.
- by defalut no text shadow (text-shadow: none)

Class 6
px: fix size. relative to the screen pixels (border, fix layout)
em: it is related to its parent font size. related to parent element, (padding, margin)
rem: it is related to its <html> root dir. related to root element(consistent spacing, typography)
    1rem = 16px
%: persentage of parent size related to parent element (_fluid layout, responsive container)
    Note: % behaves same as em (related to its parent)
vw: persentage of viewport width. (responsive layout. full width element or view port dependecy)

Font weight: text thickness controle
    defalut : normal (400)
        normal (400)

-------------------------------------
Class 7
Margin and padding
fundamentals layout tools, controle the spacing around and inside the element. 
for better visiblity

margin defalut value: 0

margin is the diff b/w elements

padding: space b/w the border and the content
padding defalut value: 0
manage the space b/w the contenet and the border.

margin vs padding
feature                 margin                              padding
- location              outside element border              inside the element border
- background visible    No                                  yes 
- collapse              vertical margins can be collapse    padding doesnot collapsed.
- use case              use to seprate the elements         seprate the content from the border for better readiblity.


short hand for margin and padding
- 1 value : applied to all side
- 2 values: vertical | horizontal
- 3 values: top | horizontal | bottom
- 4 values: top | right | bottom | left


-------------------------------------
Class 8
box size: content box - border box
box-size: it is used to calculate the width and height of an element
box-size: content box
    - The width and height applied only to the content.
    - padding and border are added outside the set width/height increase the total space.

acutal width:
    width: 200px
        20px padding left/right
        5px border right/left
    200+20+20+5+5 = 250px total width


box-size: border box - 
acutal width:
    width: 200px (include padding and border)
        20px padding left/right
        5px border right/left
    200 - (20*2)-(5*2) = 
    200-40-10= 150px

content box                             border box
width+padding+border                width(all included)

NOTE: for predictable layout especially with the grid layout and 
responsive design use border-box.


Overflow: controles what happened if content overflow in container box.
    - hidden - not visible, clip - scrollbar not visible
    - visible (Defalut) - show text outside the box - scrollbar not visible
    - scroll - clip, but scroll - scrollbar is visible
    - auto - clip, but scroll - if only required visible


Outline vs border

border: 
    affects the layout: yes
    display: color,width, style, (top, bottom, left, right)
    visible in box model: visible b/w paddding and margin.
    eg: card, button, etc.

Outline:
    affects the layout: No (doesnot takes the space)
    display: supported by element, directions not there.
    visible in box model: selection, heighlight, get the focus
    can not have border radius in few explorer, shap will always be rectangle.
