        done in html page itself.

    - Internal CSS: the styling part will done inside the html page itself. but inside the
        <head> </head>  we have to add additional tag for styling <style> .... </style>

    - External CSS: you have to create the additional file with the extention of .css
        for the styling purpose. 
        we have to link the css file with the html file.
