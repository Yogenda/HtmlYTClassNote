syntax rules
    - case sensetive
    - statement end with ; (optinal but use it a good practice)
    - wihitespace and indentation 
    - curly brackets {} group or block of code

console.log(): is used for debugging commonly used by developers
alert(): quick popup for small notifications
document.write(): old way, not recomended now a days(override the entire page)

document.write() and alert() dont use in production website -> it will provide bad UX

    - named containers to store the values

let name = "Yogendra" //store the text
let age = 27 //store the number

old way of Variable

var x = 10;
console.log(x);

    - can be re-declared and also update
Note: it can caluse bug due to re-declared nature
